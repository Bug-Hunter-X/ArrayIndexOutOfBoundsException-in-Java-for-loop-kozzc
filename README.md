# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside the valid index range.  The corrected version is in `FixedArray.java`. This demonstrates how off-by-one errors can easily occur when iterating over arrays.
